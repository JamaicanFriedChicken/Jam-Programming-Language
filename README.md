# Jam 

   Jam is mixed with peanut butter then put between two slices of bread and enjoyed on a fine Sunday morning with a nice cup of tea. 
 Jam is a Java interpreter to simply explore the small world of programming languages. With curiosity and interest in reinforcing the fundamental
 basics of HOW a language is implemented, jam is a project that will help me understand the depth of a programming language and its implementations.
